# Software Development Metrics
### DAVID NICOLETTE

## Chapter 1:  Making Metrics Useful

A *measurement* is a quantitative observation of one of following
* Something relevant to the decisions you have to make
* Information you have to report regarding the progress of Development
* The effects of process improvements

There is effort and cost involved in collecting data and tracking metrics.
A metric is considered *pragmatic* if it helps to make decisions for stakeholders.

*Leading Indicator* : Helps in predicting the future
*Lagging Indicator* :

You  use  metrics  for  two  purposes:  to  he lp  steer  work  in  progress  and  to  help monitor the effectiveness of process-improvement efforts.

#### Functions of Metrics
* Informational
* Diagnostic
* Motivational

### Factors affecting choice of metrics
#### Development Approach
Development Approaches can be
* *traditional* and this is supported by *backward-facing* metrics or
* *adaptive* and this is supported by *forward-facing* metrics

#### Process Model
Software Delivery can follow
* *Linear* or *waterfall* Approach
* *itertive* where solution is built up from series of iterations
* *time-boxed* same as iterative, but (1) it is same time length and (2)potentially shippable increment
* *continuous flow* controls amount of work in progress and using techniques from Lean school of thought

#### Delivery Mode
* Discrete Project or
* Ongoing Project
